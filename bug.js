```javascript
const query = { name: /John/i }; // Case-insensitive search

db.collection('users').find(query).toArray((err, result) => {
if (err) throw err;
console.log(result);
});
```
This code is intended to perform a case-insensitive search for documents where the `name` field contains "John".  However, if there are no matching documents it might not throw an error, but it will return an empty array. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the application if the empty array is not correctly handled as a valid outcome.
