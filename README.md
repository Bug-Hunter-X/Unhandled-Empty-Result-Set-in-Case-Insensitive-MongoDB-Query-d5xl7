# MongoDB Case-Insensitive Query Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with handling empty result sets from case-insensitive MongoDB queries using Node.js.

The `bug.js` file contains code that performs a case-insensitive search.  If no documents match the query, it might return an empty array. This is not necessarily an error, but it can lead to unexpected behavior in the application. 

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution that explicitly checks for the empty array and handles it gracefully.

## Bug Description
The `find()` method will return an empty array if no matching documents are found. This is valid behavior but requires explicit checking in the application code.
